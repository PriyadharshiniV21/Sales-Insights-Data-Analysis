# Sales Insights Data Analysis

In the Sales Insights Data Analysis project, I addressed the challenges faced by a computer hardware business navigating a dynamically changing market. My role involved performing extensive data cleaning and wrangling on a MySQL database, which housed crucial information such as sales transactions, customer details, product information, date records, and market data. Leveraging the PowerBI tool, I applied advanced data analysis techniques to derive actionable insights.

The heart of the project was the development of a comprehensive dashboard, meticulously designed to provide a holistic view of the business's performance. The dashboard featured key metrics such as revenue trends, highlighting fluctuations and patterns over time. Additionally, it spotlighted the top 5 customers and products, offering valuable insights into the most impactful aspects of the business. A detailed profit analysis allowed stakeholders to understand the financial health of the company, while performance insights provided a nuanced understanding of the business's overall trajectory.

This project not only showcased my proficiency in utilizing PowerBI and MySQL for impactful data analysis but also demonstrated my ability to translate complex datasets into visually appealing and easily interpretable dashboards. The insights derived from this analysis were invaluable for the computer hardware business, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions in a rapidly evolving market. Overall, this case study underscores my expertise in data analytics and my capability to drive meaningful outcomes in the face of business challenges.
